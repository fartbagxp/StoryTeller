This project is preparation for interview questions. It's meant to be asked to yourself.

## How to pass a technical interview

It's been a while since I prepped for a technical interview. This [blog](http://blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview) seems to be detailed enough
to go with.

Technical interview for software engineers tend to be the status quo.

It is in many ways similar to the SAT, everybody finds flaws in it, but on some level, it does work.


## Questions to prepare

### Programming language Questions

#### Nodejs

NodeJS event flow.

Asynchronous events.

#### React / Redux

Read up on how React works using the [facebook page](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Talk about React's one way binding vs Angular's two way binding. Talk about [egghead.io videos](https://egghead.io/).

Most people are using flux. The latest and greatest thing seems to be [redux](http://redux.js.org/) which has superb documentation.

#### CSS / HTML

Bootstrap and Flexbox (noob at it)

Everybody recommends learning [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

Teach yourself how to use it using [this game](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/) from hackernews.

#### Java

Concurrency in Java <-- awesome book.

Brush up on some Java.

## Typical Technical Questions

### Fizzbizz

Make a function that prints 'Fizzbizz' if it is divisible by 3 and 5, 'fizz' if divisible by 3, 'bizz' if divisible by 5.

### Palindrome

Make a function that checks whether or not a word is a palindrome. A word is a palindrome if it is spelt the same way forward and backward.

# Technology to know

## Amazon AWS

Setting up a EC2 Instance to run an nodejs instance.

## Docker

How to run the container, check statuses.

[Docker Elastic Seach setup](/Docker/Elastic-Search-setup.md)

## Elastic Search / Kibana




## Data Science

Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Means

Random Forest = Classifier using Decision Trees, supervised algorithm. Train it. Use it. Get the answer.

Naive Bayes = Classifier using probability model. Compute probability of things happening. Use it against the data to predict what the data set falls on.

K-Means = Cluster using distances (sometimes using Gaussian). Place cellotroids randomly all over the place. Calculate distance of cells to cellotroids. Move Cellotroids. Keep computing until no cell move to a different cellotroid.
